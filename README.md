# Sales Data Summary App This single-page responsive web application fetches sales data from a `data.csv` file, calculates the total sales, and displays the sum prominently. It is built using plain HTML, JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean look. ## Features * Fetches `data.csv` asynchronously. * Parses CSV data to extract sales figures. * Calculates the sum of the 'sales' column. * Displays the total sales in a clear, formatted manner. * Dynamically updates the page title with a sales summary. * Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS. * Includes basic error handling for data fetching. ## Usage 1. Ensure `data.csv` is present in the same directory as `index.html`. The `data.csv` file should contain a column named 'sales' with numeric values. 2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. 3. The application will automatically fetch, process, and display the total sales. ## Local Development No specific build steps are required. Simply serve the `index.html` and `data.csv` files from a web server or open `index.html` directly in your browser. ## License This project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
